A general purpose dynamic hash based accumulator designed for use with PADLOCK,
based off of [UTreeXO](https://dci.mit.edu/utreexo).

TODO:
-   Resolve compiler warnings
-   Pruning of nodes which are set to zero
-   Verification without storing proofs
-   Store arbitrary proofs (rather than all or none)

This crate will ideally be re-written as some point to make it more efficient, easier to read, and
less prone to bugs.
